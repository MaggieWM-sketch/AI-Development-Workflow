PART 1
Predicting Patient No-Shows in Hospitals
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a patient will miss a scheduled hospital appointment. By identifying high-risk cases ahead of time, hospitals can improve resource utilization, reduce costs, and proactively engage patients for better health outcomes.

PART 2
üè• Case Study: Hospital Readmission Prediction
Problem Statement
Develop an AI system to predict patient readmission risk within 30 days of hospital discharge, enabling proactive interventions and improved patient outcomes while ensuring ethical and compliant implementation.
Key Features

Target Accuracy: 85%+ precision in high-risk patient identification
Stakeholder-Focused: Addresses needs of clinicians, administrators, and patients
Bias-Aware: Implements fairness constraints to prevent healthcare disparities
Interpretable: Maintains clinical explainability for medical decision-making
Compliant: Full HIPAA compliance and regulatory adherence

üîß Technical Implementation
Data Sources

Electronic Health Records (EHRs): Patient demographics, medical history, vital signs
Administrative Data: Insurance information, healthcare utilization patterns
Social Determinants: Socioeconomic factors, geographic indicators

Model Architecture

Primary Model: XGBoost with regularization
Justification: Optimal balance of accuracy, interpretability, and healthcare data handling
Performance: 60% precision, 70% recall on hypothetical validation data
Bias Mitigation: Adversarial debiasing with demographic parity constraints

Deployment Strategy

Integration: HL7 FHIR-compliant EHR integration
Security: End-to-end encryption, role-based access controls
Compliance: Comprehensive HIPAA safeguards and audit trails
Rollout: Phased deployment with clinical staff training

üß† Part 3: Critical Thinking ‚Äì Ethics, Bias & Trade-offs in AI for Healthcare
This document outlines key reflections on the ethical considerations, potential biases, and technical challenges faced when deploying AI systems in healthcare settings‚Äîspecifically in predicting patient readmission and no-show risks.

‚öñÔ∏è Ethics & Bias
üîç Impact of Biased Training Data
Models trained on unbalanced datasets may perform poorly for underrepresented groups (e.g., rural, low-income patients).

This can lead to misclassification, missed interventions, and worsening disparities in care.

‚úÖ Bias Mitigation Strategy
Conduct demographic audits on model predictions.

Apply fairness-aware techniques such as data reweighing or group fairness constraints during training.

‚öôÔ∏è Trade-offs in Model Development
üß™ Interpretability vs Accuracy
High-performance models (e.g., neural networks) may lack transparency, making clinical decisions harder to justify.

Simpler models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) enhance interpretability but might reduce predictive power.

In healthcare, interpretable models are often preferred to maintain clinical trust.

üíª Resource Constraints & Model Choice
Limited computational capacity restricts use of large models.

Efficient alternatives like Random Forest or XGBoost strike a balance between accuracy, speed, and resource usage.
